# Controls

Before we turn our attention to the main topic of this document there's some setup we must do, 
especially concerning Lucio's two individual settings: 
- Enable backwards wallriding
- Wall jump on release
starting with the former.

The Enable backwards wallriding setting allows Lucio to latch onto a wall while moving backwards. 
Enable backwards wallriding is off by default. This means Lucio can only latch onto a wall 
when moving forwards or standing still and facing the wall. 
This can be very counter intuitive, defying your expectation of when Lucio will latch onto walls, 
and will significantly limit your movement options. 
For example, pre-jumping in surf can get significantly harder. It is therefore highly recommended 
to turn to setting onÂ to unlock the full potential of Lucio's movement and allow things like 
shooting at the enemy while retreating or doing corner climbs while keeping an eye on the enemy.

The latter of Lucio's two specific settings, wall jump on release, is on by default 
and aims to simplify jumping off walls for you by inputting the 2nd jump input 
required for Lucio to jump off walls, instead of just dropping down, for you. 
This can be helpful for new players, taking away some of the complexity of wallriding, 
but is widely viewed as starkly limiting your control over jump length, 
and making some techs like one ticking harder to do, for an only marginal gain of consistency. 
The setting allows you to manually input a 2nd jump input before the automatic one 
and it also allows you to manually cancel the 2nd jump input by pressing crouch after 
or while holding your wallride to cancel the wallride and automatic jump input. 
When holding your jump button while pressing crouch, releasing your jump button 
will count as the 2nd jump input. When canceling the automatic jump input 
after releasing your jump button you will have to press it again 
for it to register as the 2nd jump input. Depending on your preference, and the amount of 
control you require you can leave this setting either on or off. This guide however does 
assume that you're playing with the setting off.

After going over those two settings, let's discuss button layout. 
Starting with another almost mandatory recommendation for PC players: 
### Binding your 2nd jump input to either scroll wheel up or down. 
Having a jump button on either of those will make a lot of techs a lot easier. 
Those include things like skimming, b-hopping, and one-ticking. 
This is due to scroll wheel allowing much faster consecutive jump inputs, 
making those techs less reliant on spamming, or perfectly timing your jump inputs.

All other settings are mostly attributed to personal preference. 
Some people prefer jump on right click and soundwave on space, 
a lot of console players bind jump to a bumper or pedal instead of A / X, 
and many players bind crouch to a mouse side-button.
