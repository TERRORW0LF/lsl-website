# Introduction

Lucio's movement is probably the most essential and versatile part of his kit, 
but it can often times feel overwhelming and confusing when starting out. 
Terms like skimming, late jumping, and one ticks get thrown around to explain rollouts, 
and names like Lijiang under, Hanamura double curve, 
or Pole 2 Pole get used for training suggestions. 
In this document I want to go over the how, when, and why of Lucio's wallriding techniques 
and remove the cloud of confusion around those by coining these essential terms and names 
and building a solid foundation of wallriding essentials.
