# V-Curve

With the name being an abbreviation for vertical curve, this tech is used to get on top of overhangs.

## Execution
As an extension of lateskims the method to performing v-curves is to setup a lateskim 
directly below the overhang you want to clear. After that you turn 180 degrees 
while looking straight up in the air when performing the walljump part of the lateskim. 
If done correctly you will describe a 90 degree, vertical curve which will bring you next 
to the overhang you want to clear. You can now skim the overhang to get on top of it.

## Pros and Cons
V-curves are a great tool for quickly positioning yourself on high ground, as well as to escape enemies. 
They are however difficult to perform and kill your momentum by virtue of stopping mid-air.

## Tips
To train performing v-curves simple doorways of buildings are a good starting point. 
After which you can slowly increase the difficulty up to trick jump like the Hanamura double v-curve.
