# Jumps

Jumping is the most integral part of Lucio's wallriding kit. Without jumping off walls
you can't gain speed, move around the map without walking, dive Widow's, or better dodge shots.
This chapter will herefore explore the basic jumps you can incorporate into your movement to 
make wallriding a more useful part of Lucio's kit.
