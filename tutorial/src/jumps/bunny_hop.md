# Bunny Hopping

You might already know the term “b-hop” or “bunny hop” from other games such as 
Half Life, Portal, or CS: Source. While in those games, b-hops are a way to increase your speed, 
in Overwatch b-hops are a way to partly preserve your momentum. If you don't know what a b-hop is, 
you can imagine it like a normal jump from the ground for the purpose of this explanation.
