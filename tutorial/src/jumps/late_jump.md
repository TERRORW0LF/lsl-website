# Late Jump

A latejump is another of the more ambiguous techs for Lucio. Many people use latejump and lateskim, 
the next tech we will cover, interchangeably. This is not a problem most of the time, 
since they're close to the same thing, however, for the purpose of this document, 
I would like to make a distinction between the two. Latejumps, like jumps, 
are a useful tool for turning sharp corners or for doing jumps from ground speed 
that require you to cover a long distance to the next jump.

## Execution
To perform a latejump all you have to do is hold the wall like in a normal jump, 
but then delay the 2nd jump input to the maximum time of roughly 0.2 seconds.

Delaying the wall jump to the maximum possible time will give you a longer jump distance, 
since you travel the distance between the wall drop-off and the wall jump 
+ the distance of the wall jump itself.

## Pros and Cons
This is also the main advantage of latejumps, they let you cover greater distances than normal jumps. 
They however have the same disadvantage as jumps, mainly losing speed due to holding the wall. 
In additions they're also quite hard to time when starting out. With this, 
we can conclude that latejumps should be used where you would normally use a jump, 
but the jump requires more distance to the next wallride point.

## Tip
<div class="warning">
Latejumps are a staple of Lucio's kit, meaning you should definitely learn the correct timing. 
We'll also need them for later techs.
