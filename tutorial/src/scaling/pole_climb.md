# Pole Climb

This is another variation of the wall climb and similar to a corner climb 
in which you climb a pole by alternating the sides you jump off.

## Execution
Pole climbs use the fact that Overwatch doesn't count rounded surfaces as the same wall. 
Much like corner climbs this allows you to climb in much the same spot. 
They key part to scaling a pole is turning around fast enough after the jumps. 
This is one of the few cases where using movements keys next to W might be helpful. 
The ideal path for a pole climb is a narrow, elliptic spiral around the pole.

## Pros and Cons
Pole climbs offer no advantage over wall and corner climbs apart from style points. 
In addition they're a lot harder than the other versions and are limited to very few spots with a pole.

## Tips
Pole climbs are used in some trick jumps, most notably pole 2 pole.
