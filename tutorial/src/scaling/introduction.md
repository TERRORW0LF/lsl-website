# Scaling

Getting higher is a fundamental need of Overwatch players. Be it their ego, rank, 
or in this case vertical distance. Getting height helps you surprise unsuspecting 
Widowmakers, kill Pharah's and other flyers, escape tricky situations through enemies 
not being able to get to the high ground, and assert dominance by beating on peoples heads.
