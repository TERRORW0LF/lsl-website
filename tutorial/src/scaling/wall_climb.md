# Wall Climb

Delivering what it promises, a wall climb describes the action of scaling up a wall. 
It helps you reach high grounds and stall or hiding spots near the map ceiling. 
With this tech we're firmly in the realm of compounded jumps.

## Execution
All you have to do to successfully pull of a wall climb is to find a high enough wall, 
and repeatably jump on it while looking up. Doing this in a zig-zag across the entire wall 
is the easiest and fastest way to do this. Make sure you're conscious of the same wall distance 
you have to keep when wallriding when doing this.

## Pros and Cons
In comparison to ramp jumps, wall climbs are a lot easier to execute, 
requiring only basic wallriding and no luck. They also allow you to climb much higher, 
given you have a high enough wall. They're not perfect though, 
they will take longer than ramp jump and also leave you vulnerable in the open while climbing.

## Tips
Some of this can be mitigated by climbing the wall before the fight starts, 
earning you a surprise attack on unsuspecting enemies.
